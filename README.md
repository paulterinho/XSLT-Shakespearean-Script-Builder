XSLT-Shakespearean-Script-Builder
=================================

A Java Desktop tool for converting XML files of Shakesperean Plays into various formats (pdf, rtf, doc, txt, fop) with a specific actors parts highlighted.

Very Quick and Dirty little app. 

To use it:

* Unzip the contents of the /xml folder
* Open a command line and navigate to the project root.
* Invoke the "ant" command, it will run "clean", "compile", and then "run"
* When the play menu populates, choose the one you wish to create a highlighted script for. 
* Select the format you wish to transform it into (pdf, postscript, txt, rtf, etc...). 
* Click on the "Transform" button.
* Select the directory you wish to save the resulting file into.
* Wait (if it is a big XML file, this may take a little bit).
