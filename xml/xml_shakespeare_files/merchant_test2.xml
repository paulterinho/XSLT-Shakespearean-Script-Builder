<STAGEDIR>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</LINE>
<LINE>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</LINE>
<LINE>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</LINE>
<LINE>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</LINE>
<LINE>I am to learn;</LINE>
<LINE>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have much ado to know myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</LINE>
<LINE>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</LINE>
<LINE>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</LINE>
<LINE>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</LINE>
<LINE>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</LINE>
<LINE>The better part of my affections would</LINE>
<LINE>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</LINE>
<LINE>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</LINE>
<LINE>And every object that might make me fear</LINE>
<LINE>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</LINE>
<LINE>Would make me sad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My wind cooling my broth</LINE>
<LINE>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</LINE>
<LINE>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</LINE>
<LINE>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</LINE>
<LINE>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</LINE>
<LINE>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</LINE>
<LINE>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</LINE>
<LINE>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</LINE>
<LINE>And see the holy edifice of stone,</LINE>
<LINE>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</LINE>
<LINE>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</LINE>
<LINE>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</LINE>
<LINE>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</LINE>
<LINE>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</LINE>
<LINE>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</LINE>
<LINE>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</LINE>
<LINE>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</LINE>
<LINE>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the fortune of this present year:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then you are in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy</LINE>
<LINE>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</LINE>
<LINE>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</LINE>
<LINE>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</LINE>
<LINE>And other of such vinegar aspect</LINE>
<LINE>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</LINE>
<LINE>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</LINE>
<LINE>We leave you now with better company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,</LINE>
<LINE>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</LINE>
<LINE>I take it, your own business calls on you</LINE>
<LINE>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, my good lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</LINE>
<LINE>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALARINO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORENZO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</LINE>
<LINE>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not fail you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRATIANO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You look not well, Signior Antonio;</LINE>
<LINE>You have too much respect upon the world:</LINE>
<LINE>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</LINE>
<LINE>A stage where every man must play a part,</LINE>
<LINE>And mine a sad one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRATIANO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me play the fool:</LINE>
<LINE>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</LINE>
<LINE>And let my liver rather heat with wine</LINE>
<LINE>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</LINE>
<LINE>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</LINE>
<LINE>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</LINE>
<LINE>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--</LINE>
<LINE>There are a sort of men whose visages</LINE>
<LINE>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</LINE>
<LINE>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</LINE>
<LINE>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</LINE>
<LINE>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</LINE>
<LINE>O my Antonio, I do know of these</LINE>
<LINE>That therefore only are reputed wise</LINE>
<LINE>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</LINE>
<LINE>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</LINE>
<LINE>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</LINE>
<LINE>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORENZO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</LINE>
<LINE>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</LINE>
<LINE>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRATIANO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRATIANO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable</LINE>
<LINE>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that any thing now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</LINE>
<LINE>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</LINE>
<LINE>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</LINE>
<LINE>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</LINE>
<LINE>have them, they are not worth the search.</LINE>
